## OASIS -Order Admin Support Integration System- (Server-side)

This is a repository for the server-side source codes of my personal project (‘[SPAR](https://spar-web-app.herokuapp.com/)’).

The server is built with node.js and express.js. I also used [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) package to connect the server to database (PostgreSQL).
This server is currently deployed on Heroku.

For details of the application and its features, please see [the repository for the front-end source codes](https://github.com/taka-wtnb/Personal_Project_SPAR).
